One thing that we truly love is Open Source. We love to use it, and we also love to give back enhancements to the community. We eager to share results of our work as a ruby gem or npm package, it will help us in the first place to re-use our own solutions, and we can help others to solve their problems and often we will get feedback or patches back. It is a win-win.

And for many years we've created literally over a hundred of open source products, big and small, famous and not so. Very probably your application already depends on a few martian Ruby gems, so check out your Gemfile and count how many of them you have.

Some open source products have even grown into commercial products, like anycable or imgproxy, still staying open source at the time. [click] And today we will talk about imgproxy.

# Ruby in 2024: Still Going Strong

<!--
It's almost the end of 2024, but Ruby is still going strong! Let's look at some of the reasons for it.

# The common problem for any web app

Handling images uploaded by users: profile pictures, product photos, reviews, ‚Ä¶

We need to store them and show in various places, of course! And for this we need to:

<v-clicks>

 - Generate thumbnails to save bandwidth

 - Crop to fit design

 - Add watermarks to prevent theft

 - ‚Ä¶

</v-clicks>

<!--

And, of course, not only one need to receive images, but also then display them back in various forms back to users. And even now in year 2023 it is bad idea to let browsers download original images just to show them in some list downsized to a size of a thumb.

So one need to resize them, crop if their aspect ratio differs from desired, add watermarks, strip sensitive metadata, and maybe even apply some filters.
-->

---
class: annotated-list
---

# ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù way

<v-clicks>

  - Upload image to the server

    Probably among other form fields

  - Store it somewhere

    Often on S3 or other cloud storage

  - Generate all required thumbnails

    As many as your design requires

  - Store them somewhere

    Again S3 or other cloud storage

  - Serve them to the user

    CDN will help here

</v-clicks>

<!--

And there is kind of traditional way of doing it: upload image to the server, store it somewhere, generate all required thumbnails, store them somewhere, and then serve them to the user. I have implemented it once or twice long long time ago. And, believe me, it is not so easy as it sounds.

-->

---
class: annotated-list
---

# Problems of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù approach

<v-clicks>

 - Hard to predict latency: **background jobs can queue**

   It can take a while to get your image processed, and ‚Äúimage is processing‚Äù fallbacks are ugly

 - Hard to add new variants: **need to reprocess all images**

   Possibly millions of jobs to run before enabling it on the front-end

 - And hard to clean up old ones

   Space is cheap, but not free

 - Deployment: **gets complicated**

   You need to install ImageMagick or libvips on all servers/containers

 - Security: **it is your headache**

   Processing images on your servers is a security and stability risk,
   e.g. [PNG decompression bomb](https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/deflate.html).

</v-clicks>

<!--
But still, this approach has plenty of limitations and drawbacks:

 - that latency about which we just talked,
 - necessity to reprocess all images when you need to add new thumbnail size **prior** to displaying (you don't know which are going to be displayed, after all) and it requires a lot of time and ultimately slows you down.
 - Cleaning up old unneeded thumbnails is also cumbersome.
 - And oh yes, you need to install imagemagick or libvips to your servers and containers, and it is not so easy as it sounds.
 - And it is also security risk, as you need to process images on your servers, so any script kid can do a Denial of Service by uploading a PNG bomb and eating all the memory on your application server.
-->

---
layout: cover
class: text-center

# Do we have to do things this way?

What if we could _just_ generate thumbnails on the fly?

<!--
But to be honest, even if we got used to this approach, it is not the only one. What if we could just generate thumbnails on the fly?
-->

---

# Meet image processing servers

They do just one thing, but do it well

There are many of them:

 - [imaginary](https://github.com/h2non/imaginary)
 - [thumbor](https://www.thumbor.org)
 - [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
 - [imgix](https://www.imgix.com/)
 - [imagor](https://github.com/cshum/imagor)
 - [**imgproxy**](https://imgproxy.net/) (our favorite ‚ú®)

<!--
And there are such services, they are called image processing servers. There are cloud native ones, like Cloudinary, and there are self-hosted ones, like imaginary and imgproxy. And all they do is taking away burden of image processing from you and your application servers. And this is great!

As you can see from much smaller sequence diagram, application server doesn't have to even pass images through itself, all it needs to know is image URL which can be used to craft or construct URL with instructions for image processing service and it will do everything else by itself.
-->

# Solving it with on-the-fly processing

<v-clicks>

 - Complexity: **replace your code with a microservice**

   Throw away all these backround jobs, and replace them with a simple URL construction.

 - Latency: **dedicated service that do only images processing**

   Very performant per se, and you can scale it independently from your main application, also add CDN in front of it

 - Adding new variants: **just construct new URL**

   Construct new URL, request it, done!

 - Cleaning up old ones: **let CDN caches to expire**

   Do you really need to store thumbnails at all? Care only for originals.

 - Security and stability: **it is separate from your main application**

   It handles image bombs, and other nasty stuff, but even if some malicious code will be executed, it will find itself in empty Docker container without anything in it.

# Introducing imgproxy

- Open source image processing server
- Written in Go and C for performance
- Uses libvips for optimal image processing
- Dockerized and easy to deploy
- Most Ruby-friendly solution[^1]
- Started at Evil Martians


[^1]: That's what we believe in!

<!--
Now, to understand the technical points Andrey is going to tell you about, let me introduce to you imgproxy. Imgproxy started its life at Evil Martians, but it is now its own company, Foxes With Matches Inc. It allows you to process your images on-the-fly, without needing to do the dance of creating multiple versions of each uploaded image for different screen sizes.

# Traditional image processing vs imgproxy

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

<div>
<h3>Traditional approach</h3>

```ruby {all}{class:'!children:text-sm'}
# Heavy background jobs
class ProcessImageJob < ApplicationJob
  def perform(image)
    image
      .variant(resize: "800x600")
      .processed
  end
end
```

- Overall complexity
- Server storage needed
- Background processing (latency!)
- Higher infrastructure costs
</div>

<div>
<h3>imgproxy approach</h3>

```erb {all}{class:'!children:text-sm'}
<%# On-the-fly processing %>
<img src="<%=
  Imgproxy.url_for(
    'http://images.example.com/images/image.jpg',
    width: 500,
    height: 400,
    resizing_type: :fill

- No storage needed
- Instant processing
- CDN-friendly

## Let the community speak

<blockquote class="my-8">

I clicked the button, deployed the OSS version and hooked up **the imgproxy.rb ruby gem** in my app in under an hour.

Within a few weeks, we had switched over all of our upload, template, and graphic previews to Imgproxy‚Ä¶

Doing so resulted in the **removal of hundreds of lines of code** while also **enabling new functionality**.

## Technical example: URL signing

The only thing a client need to care about is constructing URLs to images processed through imgproxy.

Given original image URL:

```txt {all}{class:'!children:text-sm'}
https://mars.nasa.gov/system/downloadable_items/40368_PIA22228.jpg
```

Result URL to get 300√ó150 thumbnail for Retina displays, smart cropped, and saturated, with watermark in right bottom corner:

```txt {1-6|2|3-4|6|all}{class:'!children:text-sm'}
https://demo.imgproxy.net/
doqHNTjtFpozyphRzlQTHyBloSoYS13lLuMDozTnxqA/
rs:fill:300:150:1/dpr:2/g:ce/sa:1.4/
wm:0.5:soea:0:0:0.2/wmu:aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWdwcm94eS5uZXQvd2F0ZXJtYXJrLnN2Zw/
plain/
https:%2F%2Fmars.nasa.gov%2Fsystem%2Fdownloadable_items%2F40368_PIA22228.jpg
```

### Plain Ruby implementation

It is easy to implement yourself (for one specific use case)

```ruby {all}{class:'!children:text-xs'}
require 'base64'
require 'openssl'

key = ['943b421c9eb07c83...'].pack('H*')
salt = ['520f986b998545b4...'].pack('H*')

def generate_url(url, width, height)
  encoded_url = Base64.urlsafe_encode64(url).tr('=', '')
  encoded_url = encoded_url.scan(/.{1,16}/).join('/')

  path = "/resize:fill:#{width}:#{height}/#{encoded_url}"
  hmac = OpenSSL.hmac(
    OpenSSL::Digest.new('sha256'), key, "#{salt}#{path}"
  )
  signature = Base64.urlsafe_encode64(hmac).tr('=', '')

  "http://imgproxy.example.com/#{signature}#{path}"
end

url = generate_url("http://example.com/image.jpg", 300, 400)
```

---
transition: slide-left
---

### With imgproxy gem

But always better to use a battle-tested library that will hide all gory details

```ruby {all|none|all}{at:1,class:'!children:text-sm'}
require 'imgproxy'

Imgproxy.configure do |config|
  # Full URL to where your imgproxy lives.
  config.endpoint = "http://imgproxy.example.com"
  # Hex-encoded signature key and salt
  config.key = '943b421c9eb07c83...'
  config.salt = '520f986b998545b4...'
end
```
```erb {none|all|all}{at:1,class:'!children:text-sm'}
<%# show.erb.html %>
<%= image_tag Imgproxy.url_for(
  "http://images.example.com/images/image.jpg",
  width: 500,
  height: 400,
  resizing_type: :fill
) %>
```

<qr-code url="https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy.rb" caption="imgproxy.rb gem" class="w-36 absolute bottom-48px right-60px" />

---
layout: default
---

## ActiveStorage + imgproxy

What is even better: to use familiar API and don't change your codebase!

```ruby {all}{class:'!children:text-sm'}
# Gemfile
gem 'imgproxy-rails'
```

```ruby {all}{class:'!children:text-sm'}
# development.rb: use built-in Rails proxy
config.active_storage.resolve_model_to_route = :rails_storage_proxy

# production.rb: use imgproxy
config.active_storage.resolve_model_to_route = :imgproxy_active_storage
```

```erb {all}{class:'!children:text-sm'}
<%# show.erb.html %>
<%= image_tag Current.user.avatar.variant(resize: "100x100") %>
```

You don't even have to know that you are using imgproxy! ‚ú®

And you can migrate the whole application to imgproxy in an hour!
